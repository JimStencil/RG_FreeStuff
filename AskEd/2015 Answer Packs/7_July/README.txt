Answer Pack
============
This is an answer pack!  It is a collection of answers to questions that I found interesting in any one month.

The way you use this pack is as follows:

1. You can run the project directly in the simulator and click on any of the BLUE buttons to run the answer for the named question.

2. You can run the project directly in the simulator and click on any of the BROWN ('Forum') buttons to see the original forum question in a browser.

3. Once you've decided you want to use the code from an answer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18TxGiun8Jc&feature=youtu.be):
  a. Look at the BLUE button.
  b. Locate the white text in the lower right of the button.  (This is the path to the answer.)
  c. Open the folder containing the answer pack.
  d. locate the folder 'answers/'
  e. In 'answers/' locate the filder whose name you idendified in step b. above.
  f. Copy the named folder to a place where you want to work on it.
  g. DONE.  This copied folder contains all the code and assets you need to run the example.


SSK Dependency
============
Some answers require SSK to run.  If so, the BLUE button will be marked "SSKCorona" in the upper right corner.  You can't miss it.  In this case, just get the latest copy of SSK and copy it into the folder from step f. above.  

Getting More Help
=================
If you get stuck or find the above steps confusing, feel free to post a question in the Corona Forums, under the '3rd Party Tools' section. To ensure I see it and answer, make your title something like this:

"Answer Pack (MONTH YEAR) - Summary of problem."

Example:

"Answer Pack (July 2021) - Answer #4 won't run on iPhone 12"
