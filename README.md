RG Free Stuff
============
This is a collection of free stuff.

Much of what you will find here is dependent upon [SSK2](https://roaminggamer.github.io/RGDocs/pages/SSK2/).

_Free Stuff_ Contains:

+ **More Interesting Stuff**
	+ _**AskEd/**_ - 300+ complete code examples that I wrote as to answer [Corona SDK Forums](https://forums.coronalabs.com/index.php?app=core&module=search&do=viewNewContent&search_app=forums) questions made my various community members.
	+ _**SSK2/**_ - No, it isn't a free copy of SSK2.  It contains additional 'external' content not packaged with SSK2.
		+ _This content was kept separate to satisfy the site-guidelines of certain places where I sell SSK2._

+ **Less Interesting Stuff**
	+ _**AboutMe/**_ - My Resume and Stuff 
	+ _**BugHunting/**_ - This is where I put (test) code for bugs that I find and submit.
	+ _**CBE_Menu/**_ - A menu for the [CBEffects](https://github.com/GymbylCoding/CBEffects) samples.  (_May not work anymore if CBEffects has changed since then._)
	+ _**ForumsImages/**_ - Images I link to in various forums posts.
	+ _**MyPluginSamples/**_ - Sample/test code for plugins I wrote long ago.
	+ _**ParticleEmitters/**_ - Particle emitter samples I wrote for an old [Corona Blog](https://coronalabs.com/blog/2014/05/06/tutorial-designing-particle-emitters/).
