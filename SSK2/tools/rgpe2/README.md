## ADDITIONAL LICENSE NOTES
Many hours of genuine hard work have gone into this project.  

Please do not sell this code.  

If you want to modify it and improve it, then distribute those improvements: **Awesome!**

I have released RGPE to the Corona SDK community for free because I believe there is a real need for a tool to edit Corona's built-in particle emitter.  

I am constantly developing this software to provide you with a better development experience and any suggestions are welcome. 

Finally, this product supercedes my old (for-sale) product 'Roaming Gamer Particle Editor' (i.e. version 1).

Thanks for you support.
