This is a easy-to-use low cost Reversi game module designed for use with Corona SDK.

It comes with a demo project showing how to use it for games with these combinations of options:
Style - Three image/color styles.
Board Size - 6x6, 8x8, 10x10 (Note: Module supports any number of rows and columns for easily customized boards.)

The module is lightly documented internally.  (See the file reversiM.lua)

Everything you need to make a game of Reversi (AKA Othello TM) and nothing more.
