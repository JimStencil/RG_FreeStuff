Game Template: Sliding Puzzle

Three (3) Corona Game Templates each showing how to make a increasingly more sophisticated version of the Sliding Puzzle game.

Templates Included:
Basic — Most basic implementation.
Better — A more complex version that builds on the Basic foundation.
Pretty — A beautified version including art and sounds plus additional game logic.
This is a great starter project for new developers who want to learn about basic object creation, touches, sounds, and simple game logic.
